Name of Workflow: Git Forking Workflow

Description of Basic Git Workflow:
    All of the users work on the master branch and continually add and commit changes to the code; this workflow works well in small groups of people and when the team members do not work on any huge projects relating to the master branch; this is because they would not be creating another branch and just working on the master repository.


Description of Forking Workflow: 
    Forks are commonly used to manage the different versions of projects and help with software development for large teams. Smaller teams or people can fork the master repository, make independent changes, and make a pull request for the admin to decide if they want to incorporate the changes or not. A great use case for the forking process is to propose changes to a bug you have found in a project or to work on long-term projects. This workflow is commonly used in open source projects because hundreds, maybe thousands of people are working on the project and you don’t want all users to have access to making changes to the master repository.

Key Differences from basic workflow, and key use cases:
People work more independently in the basic Git flow
Most people have to do a pull request to get their changes applied to the master repository in the forking workflow
The admin decides whether or not to merge individual work into the main project
Forking workflow scales well for large groups of people and even smaller groups in the larger group, unlike basic Git flow
Not everyone has the same permissions

Documentation of git commands used, and annotated sample sequence of commands used in creating your repository:
Used GitHub built-in interface and simply created .txt files in the master repository
Rina and Gaurav both forked the repository and made changes to the README.txt 
Also used GitHub for pull requests in order to establish changes to code with the admin’s (Hrishik) permission
